<H1 class=RH1>OLE Objects</H1>

<p class=T>                          OLE                          objects can be stored                          by                          Microsoft Office 2000 in a variety of ways, depending on both the application (Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft PowerPoint) and the type of OLE object. OLE objects are structured sets of data that are either embedded (stored with the file) or linked (accessed through a path, network, or moniker). Each OLE object type (for example, drawing, music, spreadsheet, and so forth) has a specific server that must be installed to display the object properly.</p>
<P class=T>If an OLE object can be converted to a simple set of HTML or XML 
elements (such as a shape for a drawing object), the object will be defined with 
tags.</P>
<P class=T>If an object can be used as an ActiveX control on 
the Web page, an <STRONG>Object </STRONG>element will be used with the 
appropriate <STRONG>Param </STRONG>               
         elements included to define the 
initial values.</P>
<P class=T>Specific applications can set up the OLE object 
to be saved to a Web page. PowerPoint uses the <STRONG><A href="../PowerPoint/ppeleOleclientdata.htm">OLEClientData</A> 
</STRONG>element to define known types 
of data and Excel uses <STRONG><A href="../Excel/xleleClientData.htm">ClientData</A> </STRONG>for the same purpose.</P>
<P class=T>If an object cannot be easily converted for display to a&nbsp;Web 
page, it will be saved as a file (Oledata.mso) and will be retained for 
reloading back into the originating application. </P>
<P class=T>For more information about OLE objects, see the 
Microsoft Windows Platform SDK or <EM>Inside OLE </EM>

Press).</P>
