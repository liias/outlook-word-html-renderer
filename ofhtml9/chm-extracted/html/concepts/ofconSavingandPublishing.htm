<H1 class=RH1>Saving and Publishing Office Documents</H1>
<p class=T>Microsoft Office 2000 documents can either be saved or published to a Web page.
Both methods support saving static data (data or formatting that cannot be changed by the user) or interactive data (data and some formatting that can be changed by the user and whose results appear immediately on the Web page).
Both methods also allow the user to specify the title, name, and path of the saved file.</p>
<p class=T>In general, "saving" refers to saving an entire document to a Web page.
Typically, a document that is not in HTML format is converted to a Web document by saving it as a Web page.
"Publishing" refers to saving a portion of a document to a Web page using the Publish Wizard.
Note that only a portion of the document is saved, not the whole document.
The Publish Wizard offers tips and topics not available when simply saving a document as a Web page.</p>
