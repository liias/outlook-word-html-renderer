<p class=T>Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel, and Microsoft PowerPoint allow saving the background color or image to HTML.</p>
<h4>Word</h4>If the background is a color, Word implements the <b>bgcolor</b> attribute of the <STRONG>Body</STRONG> 
element using standard HTML colors. If the background is a picture, the <b>background</b> attribute of the <STRONG>Body</STRONG> 
element is used with a URL pointing to the image. Fill effects are not supported for Word backgrounds, and Theme blands are created through bitmaps.
<h4>Excel</h4>
<p>Excel supports the saving of a background bitmap through the <b>background</b> attribute of the <b>Body</b> element. If all cells are selected and a background color for cells is chosen, the background color is defined through an HTML class setting that is used by the table that defines the cells.
<h4>PowerPoint</h4>
<p>  PowerPoint saves slides to a Web page frame. The frame color can be specified for multiple slides. The background of a slide is specified by the master slide, which can store colors using the standard HTML <b>background-color</b> style attribute of the <A href="ofconOfficeArt.htm">VML</A>  <b>Shape</b> 
object used to create the slide. Image fills created by themes can be stored as 
bitmaps or as VML shapes stored in a master XML file.</p>
