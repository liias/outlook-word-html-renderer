<!-- *** -->

<p class=T>The <b>Properties</b> dialog box contains information about the current
document. Some of this information is generated automatically, such as the
creation date; other information is entered by the user in text fields, such as
the document's subject. Office programs have nearly the same document
properties, but a few are different between programs. Office stores document
properties when saving to HTML, even though they do not affect the way the
document appears in the browser.</p>


<p class=T>To store standard document properties in an HTML file, Office uses <a href="../shared/ofeleXML.htm">XML</a> contained in the <b>Head</b> element. The <b><a href="../shared/ofeleDocumentProperties.htm">DocumentProperties</a></b>
element contains subelements that represent a document's properties. Document
properties that Office recognizes as blank or default values might not be saved
in the HTML file, and file system properties are not saved.
For information about the XML elements used to store document
properties and examples, see the <b><a href="../shared/ofeleDocumentProperties.htm">DocumentProperties</a></b> element topic.</p>


<p class="T">Custom, user-defined properties are either values, or links to document content such as Microsoft Excel range names, Microsoft PowerPoint text ranges, or Microsoft Word bookmarks.
To store custom document properties in an HTML file, 
Office uses the <b><a href="../shared/ofeleCustomDocumentProperties.htm">CustomDocumentProperties</a></b>
element contained in the <b>Head</b> element. For information and examples about how this
element stores custom document properties, see the <b><a href="../shared/ofeleCustomDocumentProperties.htm">CustomDocumentProperties</a></b>
element topic.</p>
