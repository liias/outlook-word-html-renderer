<H1 class=RH1>Bullets and Numbered Lists</H1>
<p>The rich bulleted and numbered lists of Microsoft Word 
and Microsoft PowerPoint are not handled easily by HTML. PowerPoint, for 
example, even provides bullets that are images. However, the <STRONG>@list 
</STRONG>                            style aids in the conversion of complex lists to HTML.

<h4>Bullets</h4>
<P>If the <STRONG>@list </STRONG>style is supported, the 
<STRONG>mso-list </STRONG>        attribute is used to store list information. The bullet is created with the Symbol font, and fixed spaces of a specified font are used to create the space between the bullet and the text.

<h4>Numbered Lists</h4>
<P>If the <STRONG>@list </STRONG>   style is supported, the <b>mso-list</b> attribute is used to store list information. The appropriate number is written out and fixed spaces of a specified font are used to create the space between the bullet and the text.

<h4>PowerPoint Bulleted Lists</h4>
<p>PowerPoint can create bulleted lists using images for bullets. If PowerPoint is installed on the machine, the <b>mso-special-format </b>and <b>mso-bullet-image</b> attributes are used; otherwise, a simple <b>Img</b> element is used.</p>
