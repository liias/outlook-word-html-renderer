<P class=T>Microsoft Office 2000 supports Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) as a 
native file format. Using HTML, Office documents and data can be stored, 
distributed, and presented in a format that can be viewed using most Web 
browsers, while retaining the rich content and functionality of Office 
documents stored using the traditional companion binary file formats. 
This reference describes the files saved by Microsoft<font size=-2>&reg;</font> 
Excel, Microsoft<font size=-2>&reg;</font> PowerPoint<font size=-2>&reg;</font>, 
and Microsoft<font size=-2>&reg;</font> Word when a workbook, presentation, or 
document is saved as a Web page.</P>
