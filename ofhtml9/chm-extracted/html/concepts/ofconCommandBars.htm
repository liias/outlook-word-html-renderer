<p class=T>Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel support saving command bars and keyboard customizations (Word only) in Office documents. Microsoft PowerPoint does not.</p>
<h4 class=RH4>Saving command bars</h4>
<p class=T>Command bars are custom toolbars that can be created in Word and Excel. When data is saved to a Web page, the custom toolbar is not displayed, but the information is saved for reloading later.
<p class=T>Command bar data is saved as proprietary binary data in a file named editdata.mso.
<h4 class=RH4>Keyboard customizations</h4>
<P class=T>Word also saves keyboard customizations with a Web file 
using the same data file as command bars.</P>
