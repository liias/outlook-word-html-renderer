<H1 class=RH1>Copying and Pasting HTML Using the Clipboard</H1>
<p class=T>Microsoft Office 2000 applications support cut, copy, paste, and drag and drop of HTML to and from the Clipboard using the CF_HTML format (HTML Clipboard format). The CF_HTML format allows a fragment of raw HTML text and its context to be stored to the Clipboard as ASCII data.
When a user pastes the fragment into an Office application, the text retains its formatting and size, and the information is pasted in a format that the application can edit. 
If the fragment includes any unknown HTML tags, attributes, or CSS properties, or hidden items such as comments, XML, or script, they are pasted and stored in the document.
For more information about the CF_HTML format, see the Base Services documentation in the Microsoft Platform Software Developer's Kit.</p>
