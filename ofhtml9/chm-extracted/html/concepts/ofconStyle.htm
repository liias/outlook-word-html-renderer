<h1 class=RH1>CSS Styles</h1>
<p>Whenever possible, Microsoft Office saves and loads cascading style sheets (CSS) styles to preserve formatting.
<h4>CSS Styles and Office Styles</h4>

<p>CSS creates shared text formatting styles by defining 
styles in the <STRONG>Style </STRONG>element and applying styles using the 
<STRONG>class </STRONG>attribute. 
When Office reads in an HTML document with styles applied 
through the class attribute, it will attempt to create equivalent named styles 
for Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel.
<P> When Word and Excel write out a document to HTML, they will preserve 
named styles by creating&nbsp;style definitions in the style element and 
applying those styles with the <STRONG>class </STRONG>attribute whenever 
possible.&nbsp;
<P> CSS styles that are applied to paragraphs will be directly imported as 
named paragraph styles. If a style is applied to a <STRONG>Span 
</STRONG>element, it will be imported as a character style. 



<h4>External Style Sheets</h4>

<p>Microsoft Word will attempt to read in HTML documents that 
have external CSS stylesheets, but it will not write them back out again. The 
style values of multiple style sheets will be merged whenever possible. However, 
when Office writes out HTML, it does not create external CSS stylesheets.
<P> The style values of multiple style sheets will be 
merged whenever possible. For example, if one style sheet defines a style named 
mystyle as italic and another sheet defines a style also named mystyle as 
underlined, when imported into Office the combined mystyle value will be italic 
and underlined. Conflicting values will be resolved in favor of the last linked style 
sheet.</P>
