<h1 class=RH1>Files</h1>

<p>When Microsoft PowerPoint saves data to Web pages, it creates a 
main file (with the file name the user chooses) and a folder containing various 
sub-files.


<h4>File Types</h4>


<p>          
              
 The types          
              
 of files that are saved include the following:
<P>
    <!--subtable-->
      <TABLE border=1 cellpadding=5 cols=2 frame=below rules=rows>
        
        <TR>
          <TD><B> Type</B></TD>

        <TR>
          <TD>htm</TD>
          <TD>   HTML file. Each slide will have an HTML page 
      that contains the data. There will also be a master slide in HTML for 
      the slide master, and usually an&nbsp;error.htm file that contains a list of 
  errors.</TD>
        </TR>
       <TR>
          <TD>xml</TD>
          <TD>XML file. Extra information about the files is stored in XML format. 
      There is usually a filelist.xml file that contains a list of the 
  files.</TD>
        </TR>
        
       <TR>
          <TD>js</TD>

      <TR>
          <TD>wmf</TD>
          <TD>Metafile file. A backup of the slide is created 
      as a metafile for browsers that cannot display XML. Compressed metafiles 
      have the wmz file extension.</TD>
        </TR>
  
        <TR>
          <TD>css</TD>
          <TD>CSS file. Cascading style sheets define styles 
      for the Web pages.</TD>

      <TR>
          <TD>mso</TD>
          <TD>MSO file. Proprietary file format used to store 
      OLE and other data for recovery upon reloading.</TD>
        </TR>
      
        </TABLE>

<h4>Frames</h4>
<P>A presentation is made up of a series of slides. Each 
slide will have its own Web page. If desired, a table of contents frame can be 
created to "hold" the slides, so that when each item in the table of contents is 
clicked, the corresponding slide will be shown in the frame.</P>
