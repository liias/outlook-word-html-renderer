<h1 class=RH1>Animations, Builds, and Transitions</h1>

<p>   Microsoft PowerPoint has a rich set of animations, transitions, and builds. In general, whatever is displayed on a slide will be saved to HTML pages (exceptions are listed below). Animations and transitions can also include audio sounds that are converted to wav files.

<h4>Animations</h4>

<p>Animations are displayed in HTML by using the PowerPoint <A href="../PowerPoint/ppeleAnimation.htm">Animation</a> element tags. 
Animations will not play unless Microsoft Office 2000 is installed on the 
machine displaying the Web page. The code to display the animation will not be 
generated unless <STRONG>Show slide animation while browsing</STRONG>
is selected when choosing Web publishing options (if not selected, the animation information is still preserved). You must also choose the option of saving for display on Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 or higher. Animations use JavaScript and Microsoft DirectAnimation to create motion on a Web page.
<p>When choosing Web publishing options, note that you can choose to have animations play automatically or through clicking on the page with a mouse.

<h4>Transitions and Builds</h4>

<p>Transitions are displayed in HTML by using the PowerPoint <A href="../PowerPoint/ppeleSlidetransition.htm"><STRONG>SlideTransition</STRONG></a> element tags.  Transitions are created through DirectAnimation and require Internet Explorer 4.0 or higher. The same publishing options as for animations must be chosen for transitions to display properly. The same issues apply to builds, which are groups of animations and transitions.

<h4>Exceptions</h4>

<p>The following animations and transitions may not be supported:

<ul><li>Dim After Animation (for non-text animations)

<li>Chart builds

<li>Build by Letter and Build by Word

<li>Stop Previous Sound

<li>Continue Slide Show during playback of audio and video

<li>Play CD AudioTrack

<li>Custom Soundtracks

<li>RealAudio</li></ul>
