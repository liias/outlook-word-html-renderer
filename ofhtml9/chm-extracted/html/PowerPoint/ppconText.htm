<p>Text formatting will be saved to HTML. If a font is not loaded on a machine, a similar font will be used. In some cases, special symbols may not display if the font is not on the machine.
<p>Text formatting will be stored in a master cascading style sheet (CSS) file as well as the HTML file in which the text appears. Master CSS files store design information (such as slide master, title master, notes master, and handout master).
<p>Exceptions to CSS styles will be done with inline styles.
<p>Wrapping is done with the <STRONG>BR</STRONG> tag.
<p>Embossing of text is not supported. Shadowing of text is only supported in Microsoft Internet Explorer.
<p>Graphical bulleted lists will use bitmaps for bullets.
<p>Tabs are displayed with the <b>mso-tab-count</b>  style tag, which contains the value for the number of tab stops and also the width of the tab stop as a percentage. For example:<br><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<code>&lt;span style='mso-tab-count:1;width:2.75%'&gt;&lt;/span&gt;</code>
