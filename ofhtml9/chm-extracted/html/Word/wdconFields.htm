<H1 class=RH1>Fields</H1>

<p class=T>Microsoft Word fields are used for documentation purposes, but many features throughout the program
also use fields as their underlying implementation mechanism. A field includes distinct code
and results areas where Word allows rich formatting and content.</p>
<p class=T>Word marks and stores information for simple fields by means of the <b>Span</b>
element with the <b>mso-field-code</b>  style. The <b>mso-field-code</b> value represents the string value of the field code.
Formatting in the original field code might be lost when saving as HTML if only the string value of the code
is necessary for its calculation.</p>
<p class=T>Word has a different way of storing field information to HTML for more
complex fields, such as ones that have formatted text or long values. Word marks these fields with <code>&lt;!--[if supportFields]></code>
 so the data is not displayed in the browser. Word uses the <b>Span</b>
element with the <b>mso-element: field-begin</b>, <b>mso-element: field-separator</b>, and <b>mso-element: field-end</b> attributes to contain the three respective parts of the field code: the field start, the separator
between field code and field results, and the field end. Whenever
possible, Word will save the field to HTML in the method that uses the least file space.</p>
<H4 class=RH4> Binary data</h4>
<p class=T>For fields that consist of binary data, Word uses the <b><a href="wdeledata.htm">Data</a></b>
element to contain the data.</p>
<H4 class=RH4>Locked field results</h4>
<p class=T> To save the locked state of a field in
HTML, Word uses a new <b>mso-field-lock</b>  style attribute. The default value is
<b>no</b>, so only <b>yes</b> is saved to HTML. For simple fields, <b>mso-field-lock
</b>should be placed
in the same <b>Span</b> element as the <b>mso-field-code</b>  style attribute. In
the case of advanced fields, it should be placed on the <b>Span</b> element that includes the <b>mso-element:&nbsp;field-begin</b>
 attribute.</p>
