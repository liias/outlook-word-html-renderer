<H1 class=RH1>Comments</H1>

<p class=T>Microsoft Word and Microsoft Excel both have comment features, but
they are slightly different in each program. However, both programs save their
comments to HTML in the same way. PowerPoint does not have this feature; rather,
it uses the notes feature on each slide.</p>

<p class=T>Comments in HTML documents created with Word and Excel display differently
depending on whether the browser used to display the document supports dynamic
content. Scripting is used to detect the browser at load time. In
Microsoft Internet Explorer 4.0 and later browsers, comments are dynamic. They pop up like a tooltip when the cursor is positioned over the comment
reference. The comments are formatted using CSS to look like post-it
notes. Visibility is dynamically toggled through JavaScript event handlers.</p>

<p class=T>In
other browsers, comments are static. They are displayed at the
bottom of the Web page, much like <a href="wdconFootnotesandEndnotes.htm">footnotes
and endnotes</a>. Comments and their anchors are hyperlinked for easy browsing
between them.</p>
<p class=T>Word and Excel HTML comments have the following distinct components.</p>


<TABLE border=1 cellpadding=5 cols=2 frame=below rules=rows>

  <TR valign=top>
    <TD class=I align=left height="38" nowrap><b>Comment component</b></td>
    <TD class=I align=left height="38"><b>Description</b></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <TD class=T align=left height="55" nowrap>Comment data</td>
    <TD class=T align=left height="55">The data is the comment itself, which can
      contain richly formatted text, pictures, tables, and most other types of
      Office document data. When saved as HTML, Word and Excel store the comment data
      near the end of the Web page within a labeled <b>Div</b> element. The comment data
      is saved to HTML like standard Office document text.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <TD class=T align=left height="38" nowrap>Comment properties</td>
    <TD class=T align=left height="38">A set of Microsoft Office properties
      associated with a comment, such as the author's name, is saved in HTML by
      applying styles to the <b>Div</b>  element containing the
      comment.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <TD class=T align=left height="57" nowrap>Reference</td>
    <TD class=T align=left height="57">The reference is the range of character
      positions in the main document that is associated with the comment. This range is
      saved in HTML by enclosing it within
      a labeled <b>Span</b> element. Multiple <b>Span </b>elements are used in the case where
      a comment's range overlaps the ranges of other comments.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <TD class=T align=left height="95" nowrap>Anchors</td>
    <TD class=T align=left height="95">Word and Excel include an anchor at the end of the
      comment reference and an anchor at the beginning of the comment data.
      The reference anchor provides a visual clue that a comment exists and that
      it is the <i>n</i>th comment made by a given author. In browsers that do not
      support dynamic content, the two anchors function as hyperlinks that let
      the user jump between the reference and the comment.</td>
  </tr>
</table>


<p class=T>&nbsp;</p>
<H4 class=RH4>Comment references</h4>
<p class=T>Word and Excel use <b>A</b> elements to mark the text to which the comment was
applied, and they use the <b>mso-comment-reference</b>  style attribute to save the comment index
and the author's initials to HTML. The comment index corresponds to the order of occurrence
of the ends of comment references in the document, rather than their beginnings,
because references can be nested with each other. Text-level elements cannot be
overlapped in HTML, so they must be closed and reopened. In the situation of
overlapping comment references,
Word and Excel insert an additional style attribute, <b>mso-comment-continuation</b>.
<H4 class=RH4>Comment author name</h4>
<p class=T>To store the author's name for a given comment, Word and Excel use the <strong>mso-comment-author</strong>
style attribute.</p>
<H4 class=RH4>Comment text</h4>
<p class=T>All comments in a Word or Excel HTML document are stored inside a <b>Div</b> element labeled with
the <strong> mso-element: comment-list</strong>  style.
Word and Excel position this element after the <b>Div</b> element containing the main document's last section
and after any <b>Div</b> elements containing <a href="wdconFootnotesandEndnotes.htm">footnotes
and endnotes</a>. Inside the <b>mso-element: comment-list</b>  style,
Word and Excel store each comment in its own <b>Div</b> element with the <strong>mso-element:
comment </strong>style.</p>
<H4 class=RH4>Comment separator</h4>
<p class=T>The <strong>mso-element: comment-list </strong>style also contains an
<b>HR</b> element to cleanly separate comments from preceding
sections of the document in browsers other than Internet Explorer 4.0 and later.</p>
<PRE class=C><code>&lt;hr class=msocomoff align=left size=1 width=&quot;33%&quot;&gt;</code></pre>
<p class=T>The separator is identical to the one used for <a href="wdconFootnotesandEndnotes.htm">footnotes
and endnotes</a>. The <b>msocomoff</b>
 style class dynamically formats the separator so it is not displayed in Internet Explorer
4.0 or later browsers.</p>
<H4 class=RH4>Syntax for individual comments</h4>
<p class=T>The following table briefly describes the components of a comment <b>Div</b>
element.</p>

<TABLE border=1 cellpadding=5 cols=2 frame=below rules=rows>
    <tr>
      <td class=I width="50%"><b>Comment Div element component</b></td>
      <td class=I width="80%"><b>Purpose</b></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class=T width="50%"><b>STYLE=&quot;mso-element: comment&quot;</b></td>
      <td class=T width="80%">A style that Word and Excel use to identify
        the <b>Div</b>  element as the container of a comment.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class=T width="50%"><b>CLASS=msocomtxt</b></td>
      <td class=T width="80%">The <b>msocomtxt</b> style class is used to dynamically
        apply styles to all comments in a document.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class=T width="50%"><b>ID=_com_</b><i>n</i></td>
      <td class=T width="80%">Unique identifier for the <i>n</i>th comment in a document; JavaScript
        code uses it to show and hide the comment region in Internet Explorer
        4.0 and later browsers.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class=T width="50%"><b>onmouseover=&quot;msoCommentShow('_anchor_</b><i>n</i><b>','_com_</b><i>n</i><b>')&quot;</b></td>
      <td class=T width="80%">Calls a JavaScript
        function that makes the comment with <b>id=_com_<i>n</i></b> visible and displays it
        at the position of the anchor with <b>id=_anchor_<i>n</i></b>. This guarantees
        that the comment remains visible when the user slides the cursor from the
        anchor onto the comment region.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td class=T width="50%"><b>onmouseout=&quot;msoCommentHide('_com_</b><i>n</i><b>')&quot;</b></td>
      <td class=T width="80%">Calls a JavaScript function that makes
        the comment with <b>id=_com_<i>n</i></b> invisible when the user moves the cursor off
        the comment.</td>
    </tr>

<H4 class=RH4>Comment anchors</h4>
<p class=T>When saving comments as HTML, Word and Excel provide comment anchors that
help users view comments in the browser. In Internet Explorer 4.0 and later browsers, the anchors
trigger pop-up display of comments. In other browsers, anchors function as two-way
hyperlinks between the comment reference and
comment data. The <b>Span</b> elements enclosing all comment anchors in the document have
the<strong> msocomoff </strong> style class,
which is used to dynamically hide the anchor string in Internet Explorer 4.0 or
later browsers. The <b>Span</b> elements enclosing all reference anchors in the document have
the <strong>msocomanchor </strong>style class. This is used to dynamically format all reference anchors for Internet
Explorer 4.0 or later browsers through scripting.</p>
<H4 class=RH4>Scripting</h4>
<p class=T>When a Word or Excel document containing comments is saved as HTML, a <b>Script</b>
 element is placed within the <b>Head</b>  element. The <b>Script</b>   element contains
scripting statements in JavaScript that make comments dynamic in Internet
Explorer 4.0 or later browsers. Word and Excel HTML documents use scripting for two basic
purposes:
<ul>
  <li><b>Dynamic stylesheets</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; When a page is first loaded in a browser, the browser type is determined
  and, in the case of Internet Explorer 4.0 or later browsers,&nbsp;CSS styles are dynamically applied to comments
  to make them look like post-it notes.&nbsp;The comment regions are
  initially invisible.</li>
  <li><b>Event handling</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; In Internet
    Explorer 4.0 or later browsers, moving the cursor over an anchor toggles
  visibility of the corresponding comment region. The comment region is
  positioned near its anchor.</li>
</ul>
<p class=T>Word and Excel documents also use scripting for browser detection so that comments can be
dynamic for Internet Explorer 4.0 or later browsers. Browser
detection is achieved using a JavaScript function, <strong>msoBrowserCheck( )</strong>,
stored in the <b>Script</b>  element contained in the head. The function accesses the name and
version number of the browser by means of the <strong>navigator.appVersion</strong>
object hierarchy. The function returns <b>True</b> if the browser is
Internet Explorer 4.0 or later</p>
<p class=T>If the browser detected is Internet Explorer 4.0 or later, special styles
are applied to all comment
elements in the document. The style rules are applied to elements having three
style classes reserved for Office comments.&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>The <strong>msocomtxt</strong>   style class is reserved for comment regions.
    The comment regions are formatted to look like post-it notes. They are
    also made invisible.
  <li>The <strong>msocomanchor</strong>   style class is reserved for comment anchors.
    The comment anchors are given a yellow &quot;post-it&quot; note color, which
    provides a visual clue that they are triggers for comments.
  <li>The <strong>msocomoff</strong>   style class is reserved for the horizontal rule and
    the hyperlink anchors that are used to make static comments appear like
    footnotes in browsers that are not Internet Explorer 4.0 or later. These
    elements do not display in Internet Explorer 4.0 or later browsers.</li>
</ul>
