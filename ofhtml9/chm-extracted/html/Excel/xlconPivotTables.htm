<h1 class="RH1">PivotTable Reports</h1>
<p class="T">When a range or workbook containing a PivotTable report is saved or
published to a Web page, the report and its data are specified in the worksheet
HTML table. The edit time data is stored in XML elements and is not displayed in
Web browsers. This table and its associated CSS styles are used to display the
report in a Web browser. For more information about cell and worksheet formatting,
see the <a href="xlconCellFormatting.htm">Cell
Formatting</a> and <a href="xlconTables.htm">Worksheets</a> topics.</p>
<p class="T">A worksheet can contain one or more PivotTable reports. Each report
is defined by an XML <a href="../Excel/xlelePivotTable.htm"><b>PivotTable</b></a>
element within the definition of the worksheet.</p>
<p class="T">When a PivotTable report or a range containing a report is saved as
a static Web page, only the visible data contained in the selection is saved
using an HTML table. The PivotTable schema and cache data is not saved, and
therefore when the page is opened in Microsoft Excel, the report cannot be
updated and refreshed. Saving a static view of the report is useful, for
example, if the data is intended for viewing only, and if maintaining small file
sizes is a concern.</p>
<p class="T">When a PivotTable report or a range containing a report is
published using the PivotList component, only the XML elements
are saved to the Web page. The component allows data to be manipulated when the
page is viewed in a Web browser.</p>
<p class="T">The PivotTable cache schema and data are stored using XML elements in a
separate file. If the cache definition is missing or invalid, a PivotTable
report that uses the cache must be refreshed before the report is modified.
If a worksheet containing more than one PivotTable report is saved, the cache
file contains a cache definition for each report. The PivotTable cache XML
schema is based on the XML-Data Specification.</p>
<p class="T">The XML-Data Specification does not allow mixed data types within a
column schema. For example, a PivotTable based on a worksheet data source can
have a field containing a mix of dates, numbers, and strings. When the page is
saved, cache records are not stored, and the PivotTable
report must be refreshed before the report is modified. If the page is 
published using the PivotList component, the mixed data is saved as strings.
A common situation when mixed data types exist is when some entries are blank. To avoid saving mixed data, blank values are saved as nulls.</p>
